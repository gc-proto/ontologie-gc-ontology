    gc:description """
        Employment Insurance (EI) provides temporary financial assistance to unemployed Canadians who have lost their job through no fault of their own while they look for work or upgrade their skills. It also offers special benefits to workers who take time off due to specific life events (e.g., illness, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or adopted child, caring for a critically ill family member).
    """ ;
